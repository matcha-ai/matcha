# Tracing

Tracing is a technique for inspecting what happens in some block of code.
It is done by recording what was created when, what it interacted with,
when it was destroyed, and so on. Matcha uses this technique to 
automatically create [gradient computation flows](tensor/autograd) and to
[optimize for perfomance](JIT).
