# Matcha

> Attachable Machine Learning.


## About

Matcha is a library for tensor-level operations and for 
machine-learning written in C++20. Matcha focuses on
- API elegance
- Easy cross-platform runtime
- Engine modularity


## Features

- [Tensor](tensor/)-level operations of various kinds
- Automatic differentiation [system](autograd)
- [Platform-agnostic](flow/save-load) computation graphs
- Dataset pipelines
- Neural networks


## Examples

Check out [this page](examples.md).


## Plans <small>(and what's currently missing)</small>

- Extended CMake integration
- Event/callback system
- Python integration
- Java/Kotlin integration
- Graph flow control statements
- GPU acceleration (OpenCL, then CUDA)
- XLA


## Troubleshooting

Please, open an issue under the appropriate package on [GitHub](https://github.com/matcha-ai).
